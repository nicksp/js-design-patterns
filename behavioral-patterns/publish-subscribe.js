/**
 * Also known as pub-sub, Pub/Sub
 *
 * In this pattern, senders of messages, called publishers, do not program
 * the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers.
 * The publisher and subscriber don't know about each other's identity. There
 * is a third component, called "broker" or "message broker" or "event bus",
 * which is known by both the publisher and subscriber, which filters all
 * incoming messages and distributes them accordingly.
 *
 * The process of selecting messages for reception and processing is called
 * filtering. Most popular methods of filtering: topic-based and content-based.
 *
 * With this approach, components are loosely coupled as opposed to Observer
 * pattern, as they donâ€™t know each other. This pattern is mostly implemented
 * in an asynchronous way (using message queue).
